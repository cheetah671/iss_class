In this activity i have included two other shapes from the reference site given which are a octahedron and a cone.
This code makes a small 3D scene using A-FrameJS.
There’s a box at the bottom,
A cone sitting on top of it,
And an octahedron (diamond shape) stacked even higher.
All of it stands on a green plane (like ground) and there’s a light gray sky in the background.
It’s like a mini virtual sculpture — you can look around using your mouse!
